# Can MSFVenom be used in phisihing?
While MSFvenom itself is not a phishing tool, it can be used in combination with other techniques to facilitate phishing attacks. 

Phishing generally involves tricking individuals into disclosing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data, by impersonating 
a legitimate entity.

MSFvenom can be used to create payloads that, when executed on a victim's device, can provide remote access or control to an attacker. By combining these payloads 
with social engineering techniques, such as crafting convincing emails or messages, attackers may attempt to deceive users into running the payload, thereby 
gaining unauthorized access to their devices or sensitive information.

# How big of a deal is phishing, is it getting worse?
Phishing continues to be a significant threat in the realm of cybersecurity. It's a method of fraud where a scammer attempts to trick individuals into providing 
sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), banking and credit card details, and passwords. This is usually done by disguising as a 
trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, phishing was becoming more sophisticated and prevalent, with attackers continuously refining their methods to evade 
detection and trick users. However, it's important to note that I can't provide real-time or post-2021 data as my training only includes information up to 
September 2021.

Several factors have contributed to the rise in phishing:

- Increased digitalization: The shift toward digital mediums for work, banking, and communication means more data is online, and thus, there are more 
opportunities for cybercriminals to steal that data.

- COVID-19 pandemic: The pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital, creating new opportunities for phishing attacks. Attackers have taken advantage of the 
confusion and fear around the pandemic to craft targeted phishing emails.

- Improved phishing techniques: Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated, with attackers employing advanced techniques like AI and machine learning to 
make their attacks more effective.

- Social engineering: Attackers are getting better at manipulating users into giving up their data, using psychological manipulation techniques to gain trust and 
exploit human vulnerabilities.

In terms of mitigation, efforts are being made to educate users about the dangers of phishing and how to recognize phishing attempts. Technological solutions are 
also being developed and implemented, including email filters, two-factor authentication (2FA), and secure email gateways.

To stay updated on the current state of phishing, consider referring to reputable cybersecurity resources and reports, such as those produced by the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the United States, or cybersecurity companies like Symantec, McAfee, or Kaspersky.
