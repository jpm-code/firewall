# Is there any Java libraries besides inbuilt ones?

Here are a few popular ones:

    Akka: Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications. It implements the actor model which is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats actors as the universal primitives of concurrent computation.

    Quasar: Quasar provides lightweight threads and actors, CSP channels, and more. It makes it easier to write concurrent and parallel programs by providing high-level abstractions.

    Vert.x: This is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM. Vert.x enables you to write non-blocking code and provides distributed event bus that will span multiple server nodes.

    RxJava: This is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions. It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.

    Project Loom: Project Loom is an OpenJDK project that aims to drastically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications that make the best use of hardware. It introduces the concept of "virtual threads" to make it easier to write concurrent programs (as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, it's still in experimental phase).

Remember, each of these libraries and frameworks have their own learning curves and may be overkill for simpler problems. It's always a good idea to understand the problem you're trying to solve and choose the right tool for the job based on the specific requirements of your application.
