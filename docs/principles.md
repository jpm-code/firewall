A principle is a proposition or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation.

It can be desirably followed, or it can be an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system is constructed.

The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.

The entropy principle holds that all spontaneous transformations in an isolated system proceed in the direction of increasing entropy.
